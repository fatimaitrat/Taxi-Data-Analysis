## Taxi Data Analysis Project
This project explores and analyzes ride-hailing data to extract meaningful insights using Python.It focuses on patterns such as ride frequency, peak hours,pick up locations, and more.

## Project Overview
- **Domain:** Ride-Hailing services
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Marplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
- **Objective:** Analyze taxi trip data to find trends, time-based insights that could benefit both users and service providers.

## What I Did
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world ride data
- Visualized:
  - Ride distribution over hours/days
  - Most frequent pickup locations
  - Total rides vs. revenue trends
- Created data-driven narrative using visualizations
